# port/ — the decompiled port (PLAN_DECOMP.md)

Work in progress. Today this holds the **P3 scaffold**: Mighty Final Fight on
NESRecomp's legacy, function-level backend (one C function per 6502 routine),
and the **lockstep** check that compares it frame by frame with the
cycle-accurate build in the repo root (the oracle). P4 ejects the scaffold's
generated C into `port/src/game/` and cleans it up with the lockstep green.

## Scaffold

```powershell
# entry points and data regions from the P0 map (runs/cdl/*, see CLAUDE.md)
py -3 -I port/tools/legacy_config.py "rom\Mighty Final Fight (USA).nes" --map runs/cdl/prgmap.bin `
    --tables runs/cdl/tables.json --extra runs/cdl/extra.json `
    --base port/scaffold/game.base.toml --out port/scaffold/game.toml
cd port/scaffold
..\..\build_headless\nesrecomp-host\Release\NESRecomp.exe "..\..\rom\Mighty Final Fight (USA).nes" --legacy --game game.toml
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Release
```

`generated/` is made from your dump and never committed. What the scaffold
needed (details in `game.base.toml` and `extras.c`):

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| The finder decodes data as code (9,728 "functions") | the map's entry points and data regions; `disable_ptr_scan`, `disable_secondary` |
| Each task resume leaked two stack bytes | `push_all_jsr`: the scheduler resumes a task by popping the yield's return address |
| The NMI's hijacked return (`nmi_tail`, `$C119`) RTSed to `$0000` | `replace_func`: `func_C119` runs `sound_update` and keeps A/X/Y/P |
| An NMI fired mid-task (the runner's estimated-time lag) corrupted the coroutine stacks | `g_nmi_veto` (nesrecomp branch `mff-scaffold`): no NMI while a task runs; `MFF_LAG=1` brings the lag back |

Run headless: `MffScaffold.exe ROM --smoke FRAMES --smoke-interval N --smoke-output DIR`
(`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy`), or `--script FILE` for the legacy runner's
WAIT/HOLD/SCREENSHOT scripts. `MFF_TRACE=N` prints the task table for N frames.

## Lockstep

```bash
oracle=build_headless/Release/MightyFinalFightRecomp.exe
$oracle ROM --frames 7000 --input inputs/10_cody_poweron.txt --frame-log o.flog
py -3 -I port/tests/nmi_input.py inputs/10_cody_poweron.txt o.flog cody.keyed
MFF_INPUT=cody.keyed MFF_FRAMELOG=s.flog port/scaffold/build/Release/MffScaffold.exe ROM --smoke 7200 ...
py -3 -I port/tests/lockstep.py o.flog s.flog
```

- Frames pair by the game's own NMI counter (`frame_counter`, `$92`, unwrapped
  from reset) and the n-th frame showing it, so the two runners line up
  whatever each calls a frame.
- Input is keyed the same way (`nmi_input.py` -> `MFF_INPUT`): a fixed frame
  offset drifts, because the runners count NMI-off frames differently. Each key
  carries the next oracle frame's buttons (the oracle's frame RAM already holds
  that frame's pad read; the scaffold reads on its next pass).
- Ignored by default, each for a stated reason: the stack page, the tasks'
  saved stack pointers (`$82/$86/$8A/$8E`) and `nmi_return_pc` (`$A0/$A1`, the
  PC the NMI interrupted, which the scaffold never has).
- `--frame-log` costs ~135 KB per frame on the oracle side; delete it after
  the check.
- `MFF_RESYNC=o.flog` copies the oracle's RAM for the same key between
  frames (never the stack page, the task table `$80-$91` or `nmi_return_pc`).
  It realigns data, not control flow.

### What the lockstep shows (power-on through round 1, ~19,900 frames)

Identical until the first frame the oracle lags (its NMI lands while task 0 is
still running): Cody to frame 7,637, Guy to 10,433, Haggar to 7,669 with the
veto on. The scaffold never lags, and after a lag only the oracle had, a task
is at another point of its own code (a wait counter on its stack), which no
RAM copy fixes; lags also move the RNG (`rng_step` mixes in `frame_counter`).
So:

- **against the oracle**: boot, intro, title, select and the gameplay up to
  the first lag are certified bit for bit;
- **for P4**: the refactored scaffold is checked against the unrefactored one
  (same timing model, deterministic), which is exact over the whole game;
- **faithful lag** (the NMI at the oracle's interrupted PC, `nmi_return_pc`)
  is P7's timing model.
